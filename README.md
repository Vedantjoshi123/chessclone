# chessclone
This project is a clone of the classic game of chess, created using HTML and CSS. It features the same board and pieces as the original game, along with the hover effect and active effect. This project showcases my skills in web development and design, as I have successfully replicated the intricate details and functionality of the game. The use of HTML and CSS makes the game accessible to anyone with a web browser, and the project is a great example of how web technologies can be used to recreate classic games. Overall, this chess game clone is a great demonstration of technical skill and creativity, and is sure to be enjoyed by chess enthusiasts and casual players alike.
In addition to replicating the game of chess, this project may include other features such as the ability to save a game in progress.
